## Self Fulfilling Idiocy: The Game
This was an Unreal Project I worked on over the summer 2018. It's based off of a collection of videos by [Door Monster](https://www.doormonster.tv/) with some friends. It didn't get far, but together we made a basic layout for a level, with code that could:
 - Light up objects when looking at them
 - Patrols that objects follow
 - Terrain that generates to replace other terrain on a trigger
 - A door animation via code

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Self-Fulfilling-Idiocy-The-Game/SelfFulfillingIdiocy).

## Strobe
I worked in a team on a game for the Warwick Game Design game jam in October 2018. I worked on the art, while Michael did AI and Amelie did the core Unity programming. Eventually we created a fun game where you shoot lasers and you use coloured gems to change the colour of the laser. Only enemies of the same colour can be defeated by that laser.

## Spacial Freeze
After Tellas, I decided to try working on a game inside a room, where you're stuck in a Cryo-Chamber and trying to escape. You can see outside, and have telekinesis, which you can use to move objects in the room. By doing this, you get clues to the pin-code to escape the chamber. Using telekinesis, you can also sense objects outside your vision, and this is visible in a sortof lightning-like outline around the objects.

I successfully implemented the outline, and posted about it on my blog [here](https://black-photon.github.io/programming/wibbly/). Next, I decided to try and make the actual objects, along with basic lighting and shading. This created the effect in the header. However at this point I was finding I wasn't getting anywhere and the project was too big - implementing realistic physics as required would be very difficult and I was spending a lot of time fixing the model-reader. With uni on as well, I decided to postpone it and work on smaller projects.

## Reflection
For the Warwick Game Design gamejam of 2019, I worked with Michael and (another) Joseph. I worked on particle effects while Michael did art and Joseph made the core game. Eventually we got something we were happy with - a two-player game where you are either the light or dark character, the dark character representing darkness and trying to get the death fragments, while light tries to stop them. You can find the final game [here](https://joseph28.itch.io/reflection) on itch.io.

## MASS
During Hack the Midlands 4.0, Michael and I wanted to expand on Metro. Metro as an idea originally came about as a plan for the Hackathon, but eventually we went in with the plan of instead creating a GUI that runs Metro. While talking to the sponsers however, one provided a technology for natural language processing, and we decided to instead make MASS - the Metro ASSistant. The idea is this program has a console, and you tell it what you're trying to do with git. It works out what that is, then executes the command, telling you what the actual command is. The idea is that as a result, you'll be able to learn how to use things on git, and accomplish tasks that'd normally be difficult.

## Cell Assault
During the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, Warwick Game Design did a long-distance Game Jam, in which I decided to join in. I created a game where you control the number of cells in your body to fight of infection, and ended up with a game where the bugs and getting to the limits of the game was more fun than the intended gameplay. You can find and download it over [here](https://itch.io/jam/wgd-2019-20-games/rate/604650), and wrote a blog post on it over [here](https://black-photon.github.io/programming/cell-assault/)

## Hacker Hell
The second Game Jam game of the pandemic, I worked alongside a friend also called Joseph to create a game with the theme Connections, where your comuter has been compromised by hackers, and you need to put up the firewalls to stop them. You can find and download it over [here](https://itch.io/jam/wgd-2019-20-games/rate/677595), and wrote a blog post on it over [here](https://black-photon.github.io/programming/hacker-hell/)
