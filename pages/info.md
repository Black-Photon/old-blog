## Joseph... Who?

I've always been interested in how things work, and computers are among the most complex machines of the 21st century. Uncovering this mystery has been my goal that has led to numerous projects, a degree at the University of Warwick, and most recently, into a job in GPU's at Arm.

## My Favourite Language

Right now my favourite language would have to be C++

It's messy, and takes time to understand the right way of doing things; but at the same time, it gives you a lot of control as a programmer to do what you want, while providing the infrastructure to keep your code clean and readable. Beyond this, it also has support for a multitude of libraries, and as a low-level language, some of the most exciting projects are coded in C++.

That said, I wouldn't praise the build system...

## My Hobbies

Right now my main hobbies include programming, playing guitar and learning Japanese. But I also like reading, watching TV shows and playing games sometimes.

## My Ideal Holiday

I want to visit Japan! It seems like a really interesting country, and it'd be silly to learn Japanese then never travel there. It's expensive and I'd need to stay a while to be worth it, but it'll nevertheless be a unique experience.

## My Ideal Job

My ideal job is one in which I am always learning. The goal of my interest in computers was always to find out more about how they work. Anything that works to that end will be worthwhile. After all, there's so much interesting stuff in the world and in so much detail. I'd love to find out just a little more about it. In particular my interest lies in low level stuff, as to me, it's more interesting a sheds a light more on how computers fundementally work. Graphics, OS's, compilers and networks are examples on my list to learn more about!

## What OS Do I Prefer

When it comes to programming, Linux is much nicer. The file paths originating from \ make them a lot simpler, and is easy to install and change libraries. In addition, the control over the system is nice, allowing bash scripts and specific file modifications to allow you to do what is needed.

However Windows has more software support in general, and is made to *just work*, which can save time. If I could, I would like Linux with the same support for software Windows has, but for now, I keep a dual-boot on all my machines.
